Sales Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

Project Overview
During my internship at Cognifyz, I worked on a comprehensive project focused on sales data analysis and predictive modeling. The goal was to analyze historical sales data to forecast future sales trends and provide actionable insights to support business decision-making. This project involved a series of tasks from data cleaning to model deployment, showcasing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

Tasks Completed
* Data Collection and Cleaning

* Gathered sales data from various sources.
Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring high-quality datasets for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to understand data distribution, trends, and relationships.
Created visualizations to identify key patterns and insights.
Feature Engineering

* Developed new features and transformed existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Applied techniques such as encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
Predictive Modeling

* Built and trained predictive models to forecast future sales trends.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Model Deployment and Visualization

* Deployed the predictive model to generate forecasts and integrate with business processes.
Created interactive dashboards and reports to present findings and support strategic decisions.
Documentation and Reporting

* Documented the analysis process, methodologies, and findings.
Prepared detailed reports to communicate insights and recommendations to stakeholders.
